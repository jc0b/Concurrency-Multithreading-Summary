\section{Introduction}
%Lecture 1
Moore's law holds (more or less). The number of transistors on a chip doubles every two years. \textbf{But}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item As chip geometries shrink and clock frequencies rise, leakage current increases, leading to greater heat and power consumption
    \item memory acccess times haven't kept up with increasing clockspeeds, leading to a \textit{memory wall}
\end{itemize}
